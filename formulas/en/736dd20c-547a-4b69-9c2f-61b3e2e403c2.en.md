Let go! Don’t cling!

When you feel a passionate desire (dukkha), remember:

- The voice that whispers it to you is the voice of an evolutionarily advanced ape. By its nature, it cannot see the true nature of things: successful evolution requires survival and adaptability, not the pursuit of truth or happiness. **It is limited and short-sighted. How many times has it deceived you? It worries about non-existent things (the past, the future).**

- If dukkha is caused by other living beings, remember that they are no different from you. **They are poor souls, just like you, prisoners of samsara.** Any feelings other than compassion, love, and sympathy are foolish and lack logic or meaning.

- If dukkha is caused by physical or mental phenomena, remember that it is all temporary. Look at your hand, as if through the skin. **Do you see the bones? This is you.** This is what you will soon become. You are already there – perception of time is subjective, and the future is close. You are already dead. You don’t feel sadness over someone in ancient Rome who once wanted sweets, do you?

- Remember how lucky you are to have been born in the 21st century! You live better than a king! **Imagine you spent an hour in hell and were then returned. Would you rejoice in your situation?**

- If everything can be fixed, why worry? If nothing can be fixed, why worry?

- Why do you get tired? If the initial sensations are the same as an hour later, why do you feel fine at first but worse after an hour? Nothing changes. **Focus on the present moment; reset your mind.** Don’t let in a second arrow. Compare. Analyze.

- If you listen to this voice, then **you are joining the ranks of the most terrible and evil people you can imagine.** The difference between you and them is purely circumstantial. Why do you think you would behave better under their conditions?

- Remember, **it is an illusion that changing external circumstances can make you happy.** Even when you are in a beautiful place and go into a room to rest, you stop seeing the place, yet you still feel good. Right now, you don’t see this place, and you feel bad. The circumstances are the same (in both cases, you don’t see the beauty), but your feelings differ. This is pure illusion!

- Remember that **besides the observed, there is also the observer and the stage on which everything happens.** Do not identify with the observed. You are more.

# When dukkha comes, remember that this is a great opportunity for practice.

Replace the selfish and meaningless feeling of discontent with the desire to alleviate the suffering of all living beings! They, like you, are part of the universe. Only then can something change. **For hatred is never overcome by hatred in this world, but by non-hatred it is quenched. This is the eternal dhamma.**
