1. Why cling to the illusion of "I"?

2. **Everything comes from somewhere and goes somewhere.**
   - observe
   - smile
   - what's in the way?

3. **A deluded mind multiplies bad karma and suffering, yours and those around you**
   - all evil actions, big and small, were committed by people with deluded minds

4. **Break your mind down into observer, observed, and background**
   - realize that clinging to the observed is pointless and fruitless
   - what makes you think this is the truth? How many times has it let you down?
   - what makes you think it holds any value? What makes you think it has meaning?
   - clinging is not beneficial
   - don't cling to the observed (thoughts/feelings/sensations). Who is the observer? What is the background? Focus there.
   - **the observer feels no cold or pain, and neither does the background, only the observed** 
     - **you are more than what is observed**

# Right now, you're most likely in a deluded state of mind

- you're worrying about what doesn't exist (the past and the future)
- you're preoccupied with fleeting pleasures/discomforts, which will soon disappear and you'll forget them
- you're listening to an "inner voice" that's spouting nonsense unrelated to reality
- you're perceiving reality not as an illusion
- you're seeing other people as the source of your misfortunes
- you're not remembering your death, your place in the cosmos, let alone the emptiness of reality from concepts

# In a deluded state of mind, you're creating bad karma

- people in a deluded state of mind create an incredible amount of suffering. By staying in this state, you're among them: **you're no better than the worst person you can think of**, the differences are purely circumstantial.
  - bad karma will bring bad consequences
  - bad karma multiplies suffering in the world

# Get out now!

- **decide what kind of karma you'll create**
- focus on the present moment, it's all you have
- remember that all your phenomena are just images, phantoms, husks. Observe how they arise and disappear. Where do they arise and disappear?
- **divide yourself into the observer, the observed, and the stage on which everything happens, shift your attention there**
- shift attention to your breathing
- reflect on the non-existence of the past and future. Why worry about them?
- reflect on the fleeting nature of everything that happens. Why worry about it?
- reflect on the limitations of your ordinary perception (no focus on the inevitability of death, no focus on your place in the cosmos, even though these things are far more important than what you'll eat for breakfast; just like a fish thinks it perceives reality as it truly is)
- reflect on how **external things and other people cannot make you happy or unhappy**, it's your choice (think about unrealistic expectations from loved ones, who are deluded souls as well)
- reflect on the happiness of being born a human in the 21st century
