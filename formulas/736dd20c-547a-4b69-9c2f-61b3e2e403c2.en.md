1. **Everything comes from somewhere and goes somewhere.**
    - observe
    - smile
    - what’s holding you back?

2. **A clouded mind multiplies bad karma and suffering, yours and others'.**
    - all evil deeds, big and small, were committed by people with a clouded mind

3. **Break your mind down into the observer, the observed, and the background.**
    - realize that clinging to the observed is pointless and futile
    - what makes you think this is the truth? How many times has it let you down?
    - what makes you think it has any value? What makes you think it has any meaning?
    - clinging is not beneficial
    - don’t cling to the observed (thoughts/feelings/sensations). Who is the observer? What is the background? Focus there.
    - **the observer feels neither cold nor pain, nor does the background. Only the observed.**
        - **You are more than the observed.**

# Right now, you are most likely in a clouded state of mind

- you worry about things that don’t exist (the past and the future)
- you’re concerned about fleeting pleasure/discomfort that will soon disappear, and you won’t even remember it
- you listen to an “inner voice” that talks nonsense, unrelated to reality
- you don’t perceive reality as an illusion
- you see other people as the source of your misery
- you forget about your death, your place in space/cosmos, not to mention the emptiness of reality devoid of concepts

# In a clouded state of mind, you create bad karma

- people in a clouded state of mind create an immense amount of suffering. By staying in it, you remain among them: **you are no better than the worst person** you can think of, the differences are merely circumstantial.
    - bad karma will bring you bad consequences
    - bad karma will multiply suffering in the world

# Get out now!

- **decide, what kind of karma will you create?**
- focus on the present moment, it’s all you have
- remember that all your phenomena are just images, phantoms, husks. Watch how they arise and disappear. Where do they arise and disappear?
- **split yourself into the observer, the observed, and the stage where it all happens, and shift your attention there**
- shift your attention to your breath
- reflect on the non-existence of the past and future. Why worry about them?
- reflect on the fleeting nature of everything happening. Why worry about it?
- reflect on the limitations of your everyday perception (no focus on the inevitability of death, no focus on your position in space/cosmos, though these things are far more important than what you’ll have for breakfast; a fish also thinks it understands reality as it is)
- reflect on the fact that **external things and other people cannot make you happy or unhappy**, that it’s your choice (think about your high expectations of loved ones, who are just as clouded and lost)
- reflect on the happiness of being born a human in the 21st century
