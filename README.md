## How to modify a Letter

If you have spotted a typo, or wanted to modify your own Letter, please feel free to submit another PR (or an Issue) with the change.

If the modification is major, please make sure

- please provide `shared_key_uuid` (if it was regenerated) somewhere in the description of your change
- please make sure the change complies with all the "Requirements to Letters".

## Privacy considerations


### `shared_key_uuid`

Since we have asked for your `shared_key_uuid` , even though it doesn't contain any sensitive information about yourself (a random string), this might raise a Privacy concern. To address that, you could always regenerate `shared_key_uuid` for your playing account by sending `regenerate_shared_key_uuid` command to the bot. This will remove the logical link between the shared Letter and your playing account.

We ask you to do that only after your Letter has been merged to the codebase of the repository, because otherwise we won't be able to check the requirements for Letter about the difficulty, scores and the active game counter.

### Repository history

Please note that GitHub contribution model saves the history of all modifications of the repository. In regards to sharing your Letter, that would make a permanent link between your Git and GitHub information and the Letter. While there are possible strategies how to mitigate that (e.g. using anonymizers, like, https://www.gitmask.com/ or temp accounts), all them are subject to their own privacy considerations. (And if we cannot identify you as the original author, you won't be able to submit a major upate for your Letter in the future.) Please be mindful about this.

According to the license, you give everyone permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, sell copies etc. of your Letter.
