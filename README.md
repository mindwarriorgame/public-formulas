## How to share your Letter

To share your Letter, please folow these steps:

### Step 1: oubtain your `shared_key_uuid`.

There are several ways how to do that, use whichever is more convenient:

- Option 1: send `/data` message to [MindWarriorGame bot](https://t.me/MindWarriorGame_bot), find and copy `shared_key_uuid` value

### Step 2: post your letter as a GitHub issue

Create a new [Issue](https://github.com/mindwarriorgame/shared-letters/issues) for this repository and provide the following information:

  - your `shared_key_uuid`
  - your Letter
  - clearly express your intent to share your Letter on our website
    - please make sure you understand that you are sharing your Letter under [MIT license](LICENSE) (the license of this repository) and all the implications
     
## Translations

By default, all shared Letters are translated to missing languages using ChatGPT. If you'd like, please feel free to submit your own translations (add it to the Issue) 

## How to modify a Letter

If you have spotted a typo, or wanted to modify your own Letter, please feel free to open another Issue and explain what you'd like to change.

If the modification is major, please
- make sure you are using the same GitHub account that you were using for the first time submission of the Letter 
- provide your `shared_key_uuid` again
- make sure the change complies with all the "Requirements to Letters".

## Privacy considerations


### `shared_key_uuid`

Since we have asked for your `shared_key_uuid` , even though it doesn't contain any sensitive information about yourself (a random string), this might raise a Privacy concern. To address that, you could always regenerate `shared_key_uuid` for your playing account by sending `regenerate_shared_key_uuid` command to the bot. This will remove the logical link between the shared Letter and your playing account.

We ask you to do that only after your Letter has been merged to the codebase of the repository, because otherwise we won't be able to check the requirements for Letter about the difficulty, scores and the active game counter.

### Repository history

Please note that GitHub contribution model saves the history of all modifications of the repository. In regards to sharing your Letter, that would make a permanent link between your Git and GitHub information and the Letter. While there are possible strategies how to mitigate that (e.g. using anonymizers, like, https://www.gitmask.com/ or temp accounts), all them are subject to their own privacy considerations. (And if we cannot identify you as the original author, you won't be able to submit a major upate for your Letter in the future.) Please be mindful about this.
